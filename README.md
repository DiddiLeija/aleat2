# Aleatoryous 2

The second generation of Aleatoryous project.

## __WARNING! Newer generation available__

Since January 20, 2021, the [3rth generation](http://github.com/diddileija/aleat3) of Aleatoryous objects is available at
[PyPi](http://pypi.org/project/aleat3). We strongly recommend you to install the latest version of _aleat3_ library by
this reasons:

- _aleat2_ does not contain this features from _aleat3_:
  - "CoinToBinary" function
- _aleat3_ operations are easier and faster, and also much cleaner.

Also in May 26th, 2021, this [aleat2](http://github.com/diddileija/aleat2) will be seriously deprecated

We are only distributing versions 1 and 2 to record releases, but we strongly recommend
the 3rth version of Aleatoryous.
